# Assignment 1 : Code Coverage

This assignment includes:
- Creating a maven program that logs using a JSON layout library
- Discuss why you chose a particular JSON layout library
- Add a connection to MBean such that all logs are shared and can be viewed by VisualVM or similar
- Write tests to achieve high coverage
- Reflect on the test coverage reports, particularly the fact that you can't test for Exceptions that will never be thrown
